# Generate images

These models generate images from text prompts. Many of these models are based on Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1.

Learn more about the latest FLUX.1 Kontext.

## Our Picks

## **Best overall image generation model: black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro**

The best overall image generation model is black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro. It offers state-of-the-art performance in prompt following, visual quality, image detail, and output diversity. For more information about how to use FLUX.1, read our blog about FLUX 1.1 pro and check out our collection of the FLUX family of models.

## **Best fast image generation model: black-forest-labs/flux-schnell**

The smallest of the FLUX family of models, black-forest-labs/flux-schnell can generate high-quality images in roughly 1 second.

## **Best model for generating images with text**: ideogram-ai/ideogram-v3-turbo

Ideogram models are strong in many areas, but they’re especially known for their ability to generate realistic, legible text. See our blog on Ideogram v3\. 

## **Best model for generating images with SVGs**: recraft-ai/recraft-v3-svg

The Recraft V3 SVG model is the first major text-to-image model with the ability to generate high quality SVG images including logotypes, and icons. The model supports a wide list of styles.

## **Best ComfyUI model: fofr/any-comfyui-workflow**

If you’re a fan of ComfyUI, you can export any of your favorite ComfyUI workflows to JSON and run them on Replicate using the fofr/any-comfyui-workflow model. For more information, check out our detailed guide to using ComfyUI.

## **Best fine-tunes**

Make sure to check out our FLUX fine-tunes collection, which includes all publicly available FLUX fine-tunes hosted on Replicate. This collection should help you get a feel for the sorts of things you can do with fine-tuning.
