As of July 2025, the following **image generation models are actively available via the Replicate API**. Below are the **exact model names** and their **Replicate IDs** according to Replicate's own listings and recent overviews:

| **Purpose / Specialty**                   | **Model Name**                                  | **Replicate ID**                       |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Best overall image generation             | black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro                 | black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro         |
| Fastest image generation                  | black-forest-labs/flux-schnell                 | black-forest-labs/flux-schnell         |
| Image generation with accurate text       | ideogram-ai/ideogram-v3-turbo                  | ideogram-ai/ideogram-v3-turbo          |
| Generate SVGs (logos, icons, etc.)        | recraft-ai/recraft-v3-svg                      | recraft-ai/recraft-v3-svg              |
| ComfyUI workflow execution                | fofr/any-comfyui-workflow                      | fofr/any-comfyui-workflow              |
| OpenAI’s DALL-E* (official Replicate host)| openai/image                                   | openai/image                           |

*For OpenAI’s DALL-E, Replicate hosts **openai/image** as their official offering[3].

**Additional Notes:**

- Replicate also maintains a **collection of fine-tuned models** based on the FLUX family and other architectures. Each fine-tune is identified by its own Replicate ID, all accessible under the FLUX fine-tunes collection[2].
- These models represent the latest widely-used and officially supported generative models on Replicate as of mid-2025[2].
- For more specialized or niche tasks, Replicate frequently adds new models, including domain-specific or fine-tuned versions. The IDs above represent the principal, most up-to-date models listed for core image generation use cases.

For comprehensive and always up-to-date listings, developers should refer to Replicate’s official [text-to-image model collection][2], as model availability can change rapidly in the image generation landscape.
